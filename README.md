# Customer Spending and Transaction Analysis

**Executive Summary:**  
This project analyzes customer demographics and transaction data using **SQL + Python** to uncover spending behaviors, popular product categories, and seasonal trends. The results highlight which groups drive the most revenue, when spending peaks, and how businesses can optimize marketing and product strategies.  

Datasets were obtained through Kaggle.

Using Python and data analytics libraries, the analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of spending trends.

### Key Questions

#### Demographic Analysis

1. What is the average spending by region and gender?
2. Trend of income vs spending habits by age and product category?

#### Transaction Analysis

1. Which is the most popular product category?
2. What's the average spending per transaction by product category?
3. What's the monthly trend in transactions?
4. Are the most purchases cheap?

**5. Average Transactions per Category**  
  - Categories differ in transaction frequency:  
  - Some drive frequent low-value purchases (e.g., groceries).  
  - Others drive fewer but high-value transactions (e.g., electronics).

**6. Monthly Trend of Spending by Category**  
- Seasonal spikes suggest holidays, promotions, or demand cycles.  
- Consistent categories show stable baseline demand.

**7. Distribution of Transaction Amounts**  
- Most purchases are **low to mid-range**.  
- A long-tail distribution exists with fewer **high-value transactions**, typical of retail data.
